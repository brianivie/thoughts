# COVID-19 Vaccine

Our bodies have many natural defences agains infections and diseases.  On of the most powerful is the production of antibodies.  When our bodies are exposed to foreign elements, cells in our bone marrow will produce antibodies specifically engineered to attack a part of the foreign element called an antigen.  This attack is very specific (a single antibody is very specific to  one, and only one kind of antigen).  

Once our body has created an antibody for a specific antigen (foreign element), its ability to reproduce those efforts the second, third, fourth and so on ... times is significantly faster.  This is how vaccines work.  Our body is exposed to a "non virulent" form of the virus (think of them as cars with the engines damaged or removed)  Our body develops antibodies for the car's body, and then when it encounters others with similar bodies, it is able to quick mount an attack to defend against that particular virus.

A virus consists of a shell that is made up of proteins along with other molecules (depending on the kind of virus).  These proteins suround and protect the insides of the virus where there is a strand of DNA (or RNA).  The virus attaches itself to a cell, injects its DNA, and then the cell becomes a manufacturing plant for millions of viruses, duplicating the DNA of the virus to create the proteins and DNA/RNA of the virus.  Enventually the cell may explode releasing all these copies.

The question becomes, how do we get a lot of the virus, but make it non-virulent so that it can't reproduce any more?  The thought came to me this morning.  What if we used nuclear radiation?  We grow trillions of copies of the virus in petri dishes with live cells.  Then we expose then to just the right amount of nuclear radiation that it messes up all of the DNA/RNA so that they no longer will work for making new copies.  (If it is RNA there isn't a second strand and so these errors introduced wouldn't be fixed like they are with DNA).  

The radiation wouldn't mess up the protiens of the virus, and so the part our bodies react to in order to create antibodies would still be viable (useful for stimulating the creation of antibodies).

Questions:  
1. Is the COVID-19 virus an RNA or DNA one?
2. Has exposure to different levels of radiation been tried for creating a non-virulent form of the virus that can be used as a vaccine?
3. Can we ask for volunteers to test this vaccine in order to determine its efficacy?
